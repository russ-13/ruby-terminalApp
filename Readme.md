# The Day Spa

## Software Development Plan

### Description

The application will provide a database of existing clients for a Day Spa business. It will feature the ability to create new customers, view their customer details and store their number of loyalty points, with the ability to reset this counter or inform the staff member when the customer is eligible for a free session or other reward/discount. It will be used by Day Spa staff and have a password to protect unauthorized usage and feature a function for the staff member to check upcoming birthdays and display the customers phone number to send out advertising material and birthday deals. 

### What Will This Program Solve?

It solves a real world problem in a business that I own,  where loyalty cards are often destroyed. These points are tracks on paper cards and simple stamps can be destroyed in the wash or faked easily. Customer details have previously been recorded on paper and handwriting can be misinterpreted leading to lost customer details.

### Target Audience

The target audience will be the behind the counter staff of a day spa business working at the store on any particular day. It could be very simply modified for many types of businesses needing a customer database and loyalty point system.

### How will the Target Audience Use It?

The store worker will run the program after entering their password, and exit it at the end of their shift. They can  select from these options.
  1) Create Customer
  2) View Customer
  3) View All Customers
  4) View Birthdays
  5) Book Customer
  6) Delete Customer
  7) Exit

Upon selecting add new customer, they will be able to assign a new customer to the database and enter their contact information, and assign a beginning number of loyalty points depending on the type of service they are booking in at the time. 
When booking in a new customer, they will search for a return the existing customer, and be presented with how many loyalty points they have. The user can then reset their points and not charge the customer for the current booking, or add a number of points depending on the booking they are making. 
The customers details and loyalty points will then be saved for the next time they arrive.
